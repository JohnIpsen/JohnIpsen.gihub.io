      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p class="aboutP">
        My name is John Ipsen. I'm a student at the University of Idaho with a
        passion for business and technology. I aim high and work hard with a
        devotion to being successful. Here is a little bit about myself. Hope
        you enjoy!

        <div class="aboutBoxChildP">
          <p>
            I grew up in Southeastern Idaho where my fatherâ€™s ranch helped to
            teach me the importance of hard work. My father became an early
            adopter of technology in the cattle industry by first, introducing a
            website for the business, and later, transitioning to a completely
            online cattle sale. I saw firsthand the benefits technology can
            bring, and grew passionate towards it.

            My competitive nature helped me to prove myself and develop into a
            leader as I totaled eight seasons as a team captain across three
            high school sports. My leadership abilities later transitioned into
            my time at college with the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. I served the
            fraternity externally as a interim recruitment chair and internally
            as a brotherhood chair. My competitiveness naturally brought out an
            entrepreneurial passion, leading me to participate in the Idaho
            Pitch, an entrepreneurial competition hosted by the University of
            Idaho.

            I have always had an interest in business and technology, and I am
            actively increasing my knowledge and skills in both disciplines. I
            am currently in a mentorship with Fenway Group, a company that
            competes as an alternative to offshore IT outsourcing. My time with
            Fenway Group has accelled my abilities in many areas. If you want to
            read more about Fenway Group and what they offer, the University of
            Idaho featured me in an article that you can read

            I am finishing up my degree in Management Information Systems and am
            expecting to graduate this coming May. When I'm not studying or
            working with Fenway Group, I enjoy playing basketball, golfing,
            practicing guitar, gaming, or simply hanging out with friends. I am
            also studying to achieve the Microsoft MTA certification and working
            on developing a portfolio of projects to display my skills.

      <h2>Where I'm going</h2>
      <p class="aboutP">
        My career goals embody my passion, competitiveness, and ambition. I
        believe that I bring a unique skill set in that I am capable of
        providing value to an organization internally or externally. I am able
        to effectively communicate with both an IT and business department. I
        want to work in development with the five year plan of transitioning to
        management. From there, I see the next step as an analyst and consultant
        with the goal of ultimately achieving executive management.
