      <h2>Where I've been</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Southeastern Idaho where my fatherâ€™s ranch helped to teach
        me the importance of hard work. My father became an early adapter of
        technology in the cattle industry by first, introducing a website for
        the business, and later, transitioning to a completely online cattle
        sale. I saw firsthand the benefits technology can bring, and grew
        passionate towards it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My competitive nature helped me to prove myself and develop into a
        leader as I totaled eight seasons as a team captain across three sports.
        My leadership abilities later transitioned into my time at college with
        the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. I served the fraternity externally as a
        interim recruitment chair and internally as a brotherhood chair. My
        competitiveness helped me gravitate towards business. I participated in
        the Idaho Pitch, an entrepreneurial competition hosted by the University
        of Idaho. I have also competed in two business simulations against my
        peers, winning the first and being invited to a national level. The
        second will be completed in December.

      <h2>Where I'm going</h2>
      <p>
        My career goals embody my passion, competitiveness, and ambition. I
        believe that I bring a unique skill set in that I am capable of
        providing value to an organization internally or externally. I am able
        to effectively communicate with both an IT and business department. I
        want to work in software development with the five year plan of
        transitioning to management of a software development team. From there,
        I see the next step as an analyst and consultant with the goal of
        achieving executive management.
